<b> Used supersimpledev's amazon repository as a template css and edited accordingly, followed along his js tutorial. Used stack overflow when faced with challenges. </b>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

  1. <b>To ease workload of front-of-the-house workers in times of manpower shortage</b>
  2. <b>Allow customers to order at their own pace to prevent any wrong orders. Currently, the menus are only at the cashier.</b>
  3. <b>Crowd management during peak lunch and dinner hours such that ordering and receiving items will be quicker.</b>

<h2>Current features</h2>
<p>Currently, only the customer side has been built but still a WIP</p>
